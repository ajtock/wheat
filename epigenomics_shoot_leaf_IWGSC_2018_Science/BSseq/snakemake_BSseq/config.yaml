  # This directory must contain the bisulfite-converted
  # reference genome index for bowtie2, generated by
  # data/index/bismark_genome_preparation.sh;
  # i.e., a subdirectory named "Bisulfite_Genome".
  # It must also contain the FASTA file from which the
  # index was built (e.g., wheat_v1.0.fa),
  # and a chromosome sizes file (e.g., wheat_v1.0.fa.sizes),
  # generated with:
  # samtools faidx wheat_v1.0.fa; cut -f1,2 wheat_v1.0.fa.fai > wheat_v1.0.fa.sizes
  reference: "data/index/"
  # reference_prefix is used for naming alignment output files;
  # this should be the name of the FASTA file (e.g., wheat_v1.0.fa)
  # without the .fa extension

BEDGRAPH:
  # --buffer_size (e.g., 50%) option applies only when UNIX 'sort' is used
  # UNIX 'sort' is not used where --ample_memory is specified
  # "This may result in a faster sorting process for very large files,
  # but this comes at the cost of a larger memory footprint...
  # Note however that due to the overheads of creating and looping
  # through arrays, this option might in fact be *slower* for small-ish
  # files (up to a few million alignments). Note also that this option is
  # not currently compatible with options '--scaffolds/--gazillion'."
  # --buffer_size 50% would be more appropriate than --ample_memory
  # for smaller genomes (e.g., TAIR10)
